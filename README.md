# slugs-snails
Group project python app that recognizes and identifies snail and it's type. My responsibility was creating and training the recognizer. Based on openCV, model was trained with ~40 positive and ~120 negative images for each of 3 types of snails.
Because of lack of access to bigger photo database, the program works fairly inconsistently
